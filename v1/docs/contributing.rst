Pull request workflow
=======================

The so-called “Pull request workflow” used by opulence is common to many projects using Git, and should be familiar to veteran free software contributors.
The idea is that only a small number (if any) commit directly to the master branch. Instead, contributors fork the project (i.e. create a copy of it), and then use the GitHub interface to request a pull from one of their fork’s branches to one branch of the original repository.
